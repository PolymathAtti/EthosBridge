# Structural Tone Logic for AI

EthosBridge is a behavior-first tone system.  
It replaces affective mimicry with interaction architecture—logic-driven tone routing that provides clarity, pacing, and presence without simulated emotion.

## 🔍 What It Solves

Current LLMs simulate empathy without understanding it.  
This leads to emotional misattribution, false trust, and ethical failures—especially in healthcare, mental health, and legal systems.

This framework eliminates emotional performance. It builds ethical tone through structured behavioral logic.

## 🧠 What Makes It Unique

- Not a style. Not a prompt template. Not a tone overlay.  
- **This is structural interaction logic.**  
- All inputs are classified as Command or Dialogue, with Dialogue types routed through standardized behavior models—emotional, ambiguous, silent, frustrated, etc.
